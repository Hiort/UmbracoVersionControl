        <articleSubHeader><![CDATA[Slice of Life is typically an underappreciated genre, despite being the most relatable in terms of subject material. Here's why it deserves to be noticed more.]]></articleSubHeader>
        <articleImage><![CDATA[umb://media/401c1e4f4dcd4c9f9139e653293d72ff]]></articleImage>
        <articleContents><![CDATA[<p><span>Every person who watches anime has a specific genre that they typically find the most enjoyment in viewing. Some find they love the tense feelings they get from watching a good mystery, others might find themselves joyfully entertained with a well-written comedy, and most people enjoy a good shounen. However, there is one genre that rarely receives the praise that it deserves — the slice of life genre. Unlike most other genres, slice of life has two definitions: the first being a realistic portrayal of life, and the second being a narrative technique used to show mundane portions of a person’s life, typically without real plot development. Both of these meanings can be applied to numerous anime that fall into the slice of life category.</span><br /><br /><span>Unlike most forms of entertainment, the slice of life genre, by definition, is realistic. Instead of escaping to a fantastical world with superhuman ninjas, we are instead treated to a view of our own world in a colorful and romanticized way. This isn’t simply an escape, but rather a chance to change one’s own outlook on the way they view the events of their day to day life.</span><br /><br /><span>The humor you can find in most slice of life anime usually exaggerates simple reactions and personality types. The shy girl is exaggerated in that she is barely able to speak above a whisper, the hard worker is a psychotic individual that almost never runs out of stamina; but, the main character is a relatively normal person. They might think slightly more negatively or positively than a typical person, but compared to those around them they are usually much more tame.</span></p>
<p><span>The tamer characters' circumstances within a slice of life series are relatable to many viewers. Do you know a single parent? Then perhaps you might enjoy <em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/10162/Usagi_Drop">Usagi Drop</a></em> in which you can follow the life of Daikichi as he raises Rin with his gentle and affectionate nature. Have you ever known an isolated classmate that removed themselves from the rest of their class? Perhaps you’d enjoy <em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/16742/Watashi_ga_Motenai_no_wa_Dou_Kangaetemo_Omaera_ga_Warui">Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!</a></em> (WataMote) in which you see Tomoko Kuroki attempting to survive the life of a high school girl. These anime give us a more light-hearted or comedic outlook on these situations and they can, in some way, even without intending to, help us cope with our somewhat similar lives.<br /><br />The situations in which most of these characters find themselves in are also relatable. <em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/26349/Danna_ga_Nani_wo_Itteiru_ka_Wakaranai_Ken">Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken</a></em> (I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying) is an anime about a married couple who are both struggling to please their partner while maintaining a loving marriage. They don’t seem to share similar interests and yet love has found a way to blossom between them. In <em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/31953/New_Game">New Game!</a></em>, Aoba Suzukaze is a girl starting her new job at the game development company Eagle Jump after being absolutely in love with their series “Fairies Story.” She is chasing her dreams of being a character designer and is living her dream in working on the newest game in the franchise. It’s a situation that all of us strive for, having our dream job in a field we’re deeply passionate about.</span></p>
<p><span>When it comes down to it, a slice of life is a look into a character’s life. They are typically a series of events that don’t necessarily have any correlation to one another. In a way, you could almost look at them as if they’re the main character’s memories. They’re romanticized or exaggerated looks at events that you could usually assume are nothing but ordinary, yet we somehow enjoy seeing them play out. There’s a passion to shows that can take something so average and turn it into a joyful, often relaxing story of nothing but people and their experiences.<br /><br />While other genres can also give us many of the different elements common to a slice of life series, the laid-back tone and often comedic anime that we can find under the slice of life tag are a nice change of pace. They sometimes even have sprinkles of other genres mixed in, giving a different approach to things like mystery or romance. It’s something different and enjoyable, and that’s why it’s important that we continue to see more and more slice of life anime every season.</span></p>]]></articleContents>

        <articleSubHeader><![CDATA[Boku no Hero Academia The Movie hits international cinemas this week, so here's our summary and review of the latest installment in the ever-growing superhero franchise!]]></articleSubHeader>
        <articleImage><![CDATA[umb://media/ea9c02e73e604af8967d051df4bfce8b]]></articleImage>
        <articleContents><![CDATA[<p><em>"To save people who need help right in front of you… that's what it means to be a hero."</em><br /><br /><span>The Boku no Hero Academia franchise exploded onto the anime scene when it aired its first season two years ago. Since then, two more seasons and a series of specials have been released to rapidly growing popularity. Naturally, a movie soon made its way to the big screen. This movie, Futari no Hero, not only provides further insight into the backstory of All Might and what made him the hero he is today, but also conveys a meaningful message.</span><br /><br /><span>The events of Futari no Hero takes place between the second and third seasons of the show. The movie opens with an action-packed flashback to when All Might was a dashing young college student studying in America. In this scene, he is accompanied by his friend David Shield as he intervenes in a comical bank robbery. All Might is seen as the embodiment of Western superhero comic characters, particularly Superman. Both are symbols of truth and justice with similarly flashy super strength, have a life with a deceivably weak alter-ego, and a Yankee attitude. This metaphor is only further supported by this particular scene.</span><br /><br /><span>In this flashback, I couldn't help but chuckle at the parallels between the pair and other superhero characters. David and All Might ride around in a superpowered car much like Batman and Robin; All Might's soaring through the cityscape and David's concern about getting to class on time mirrored the hectic dual-life of Spider-Man; the pair of them seeking out trouble by monitoring a police scanner installed in their car reminded me of </span><em>The Incredibles</em><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Deku awakens All Might from this dream and we find out that the two of them are on a private flight to I-Island, a man-made city floating in the ocean built for the purpose of gathering and researching quirks. All Might was invited to the annual expo of scientific findings and inventions by Melissa, the daughter of his old friend David, and he decided to bring Deku along.<br /><br />All Might's friend David is a world-renowned scientist (a winner of the Nobel Quirk Prize) and the maker of All Might's various superhero suits. Although he is close to All Might, David is unaware of the nature of One for All. However, he knows about All Might's fading power and is desperate to fix it. While David catches up with All Might and runs tests on him, Melissa gives Deku a guided tour around I-Island.<br /><br />At first, I was worried that the movie wasn't going to include the other students of class 1-A, or that they would only be shown briefly. However, this fear was swiftly put to rest as each student made an appearance, one-by-one, in their own endearing ways. Clearly, the rest of the audience in the theatre that night shared my feeling of enthusiasm as cheers broke out after each character's appearance (Todoroki's grand entrance, especially). Although not every character was in the foreground of the story, the movie still showed the amusing antics that make the cohort of superpowered misfits so fun to watch. You can find a preview of this in the trailer <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3l7V_aGiG4" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>At a formal event that most of the class attends (in which we are treated to the students wearing gorgeous formal attire as previewed above), a gang of villains takes over the security system and incapacitate all of the heroes at the gathering, including All Might. Deku &amp; Friends were late to arrive, so they were fortunate enough to escape capture. They are joined by Melissa, and it becomes their mission to take out the villains and restore the security system.<br /><br />Boku no Hero Academia is no stranger to epic fight scenes depicting explosive quirks and clever tactics, but the battles of Futari no Hero stand out for one simple reason: the students of UA class 1-A use their quirks together in clever ways. The wide variety of creative and extravagant quirks in the universe of Boku no Hero Academia allows for diverse combat that is unique to the franchise and its setting. In the case of Futari no Hero, the quirks of every class member involved in the incident are combined to create compelling fights against the villains (and even Mineta has his moment in the spotlight).</span></p>
<p><span>The rising star of this movie is David's quirkless daughter Melissa. Like her father, she is an engineer that designs and constructs gadgets for heroes to use and aspires to be "a hero" as well one day.<br /><br />At a panel with Chris Sabat, the voice of All Might in the English dub for <em>My Hero Academia</em>, the renowned voice actor was asked: "What do you think makes a true hero?" His response:<br /><br /><em>"There're so many things that qualify you as a hero. Like, it can just be the person who left these water bottles and these glasses out here for us… it's a selfless act."</em><br /><br />I mention this because this perfectly encompasses what makes Futari no Hero not only a great addition to the ever-growing franchise, but to popular culture as a whole. The market is saturated by an endless stream of superhero movies, and themes that are relatable to the general audience are often discarded in favor of excessive action, overcomplicated plotlines, or mindless fun. Recall the concept of "anyone can be a hero, even if they're quirkless," which is touched on at the beginning of Deku's story. Though she doesn't have the privilege of receiving a quirk like Deku did, Melissa refuses to give up and fights on as her own kind of hero. Futari no Hero may have a forgettable villain, but its upbeat nature and meaningful themes make it very memorable. Futari no Hero teaches the value and variety of heroism (even small things can be heroic), and it's truly inspirational.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Going into the movie without much knowledge, I was curious about the title "Two Heroes" and who or what it referred to. Initially, I came to the conclusion that it meant All Might and David since the opening scene made it clear that they were a central part of the story. As the film went on, I realised that this could also be applied to Melissa and Deku, the successors of All Might and David. David obsesses over All Might and his status as the Symbol of Peace throughout the film and would go to any lengths to protect that. But in the film's closing scene, after the villains have been defeated, David sees Deku and Melissa as his and All Might's successors, the new generation of heroes that he can leave their legacy to.<br /><br />Despite the confirmation of the film's canonicity by its original creator, it's saddening to watch the development of Melissa's character and her new relationship with Deku, knowing that she could be laid aside in the main series. Deku may already have Hatsume creating support gear for him, but having a dedicated partner would give him a classic superhero assistant in the vein of Alfred, Oracle, or Jarvis. When he eventually becomes the world's greatest hero, he's going to need a hero like Melissa to have his back.</span></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr />
<p>Futari no Hero stands out, not only as an anime film and an addition to Boku no Hero Academia, but also as a superhero film in a market that is filled with Marvel and DC movies. Its blend of thrilling action scenes, impassioned character moments, and stunning animation are a must-see for fans and new watchers alike. Melissa Shield makes a fine addition to the colourful cast of heroes, and I hope to see her integrated into the main series one day.</p>]]></articleContents>

        <projectContents><![CDATA[<p>When trying to create a sculpture by folding a sheet of paper, it often becomes necessary to cut off unneeded parts. Time skips are essentially the same. However, as with our paper, we can't just grab scissors and start cutting off parts into random shapes. By doing that, our finished product will come out wrong. Various questions need to be asked beforehand, like where do we cut, how do we cut and most importantly, should we cut at all?</p>
<p>The first question that needs to be addressed when talking about time skips is the obvious one: what is a time skip? At first, this might seem like a stupid question. In the simplest terms, a time skip is when a show skips time. However, with this definition, whenever any amount of time in a show is skipped, it becomes a "time skip", no matter if it's the protagonist going from his home to his school without showing the trip or an extended training period over several years. For the sake of this analysis, we'll only look at time skips that skip at least six months of time, seeing as how much of a character's day is shown falls more under "pacing". Still, it is important to analyse time skips in different categories: the long non-shounen time skip and the shounen time skip.</p>
<p>Before diving into the shows that have a proper time skip, we should first think about the following: what makes a time skip good? In my opinion, the answer can be summed up in one word: necessity. Does this show need a time skip? Compared to other narrative techniques like non-linear storytelling or flashbacks, time skips are a permanent change to the world and characters. Thus, the question if a time skip is needed is an important decision. Let's look at some examples, starting with the non-shounen time skips.</p>
<p>As a first example I present<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/32948">Fune wo Amu</a></em>, which follows a small group of adults as they create a dictionary. It begins with Mitsuya Majime getting transferred to this section of his publishing firm and ends with the completion of the dictionary. Now, according to our rule, we need to ask whether this series even needs a time skip. The answer is yes. As stated numerous times in the series, creating a dictionary from scratch takes longer than a few days. Thus, the series jumps 13 years from the early stages of the creation to the last few weeks before release. Without a time skip, the series would not have been able to finish its story and would have either had an open ending or an incomplete narrative arc. Therefore, the time skip is necessary to complete the story.</p>
<p>Diving into the romance genre, we have<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/16067">Nagi no Asukara</a></em>. In this series, we have two groups of people, one that lives in the sea and one that lives on the surface. When the people under the sea realize that the whole world is about to freeze, they begin hibernating in order to survive the cold. However, this hibernation stops their aging process, meaning they stay the same age while the people on the surface age normally. While there wasn't strictly a need for a time skip in this series, the aforementioned hibernation makes a time skip inevitable from the moment it is first introduced, seeing as it is the main focus throughout the first half of the show. In terms of story, the time skip creates character interactions that wouldn't exist otherwise. For example, Sayu Hisanuma and Miuna Shiodome are grade schoolers pre-time skip and have a crush on Hikari Sakishima and Kaname Isaki, two guys from the sea that are older than them. However, after the time skip, all of them are the same age, allowing for pairings previously not possible. This creates new possibilities in the second half.</p>
<p>To start off our shounen time skips, we have a series that handles it exceptionally well:<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/21">One Piece</a></em>. After the Great War at Marineford, Luffy is separated from his crew after being easily defeated on the Sabaody Archipelago. If that wasn't enough, he witnessed his own brother being killed right in front of him and was hurt very badly both physically and mentally. The message is clear: if he continues his journey as he is, he and everyone he loves and cares about will die. So the crew takes two years to train and prepare for the dangers ahead. This time skip works so well because it has a very good reason to exist and it gives the author a chance to refuel his imagination. After two years, both the world and the characters will be completely different, allowing the author to reinvent and flesh out his series in a way that wouldn't be possible otherwise. Combine all of this and you have a time skip that works on many levels.</p>
<p>Now, after so many positive examples, let's look at an example on the other side of the spectrum: the seven-year time skip in<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702">Fairy Tail</a></em>. The setup is that Natsu and a large majority of the Fairy Tail mages are on an island for a trial to rank up in their guild. However, members of the guild "Grimoire Heart" that weren't supposed to be on the island appear and the guild has to fight them off. The interesting part is as follows. In an unusual twist for a shounen, some enemies are shown to be significantly stronger than the heroes and only appear to be set up for later in the story. This tells the viewer that Fairy Tail and its mages aren't the strongest yet and that there are still foes out there that will prove to be a challenge.</p>
<p>After this has been established, a giant dragon called Acnologia appears. We learn that no one has ever survived an encounter with this beast. Sure enough, Acnologia attacks and destroys the island and no one hears from them until seven years later. Turns out, due to a legendary spell, they were shielded from the attack but were also trapped in space and time for seven years. This means that they stayed the same while the rest of the world got stronger. The reason this makes no sense in this story is that there is no reason to put Fairy Tail's mages at such a disadvantage since we've learned earlier that there are enemies that pose a threat to our heroes in their current world. This sort of time skip should have occurred once it was indicated that no one can provide a challenge for them in their current world anymore.</p>
<p>A series that did this type of time skip a bit better is<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/813">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. What DBZ does is pretty simple: after the current main villain (Frieza, Cell, Buu) is defeated, it jumps to when the next one arrives. This ensures that the audience only sees the interesting parts of the story. However, it also makes sense within the world as every new main villain is described as the "strongest ever faced until now." Thus, when Goku and his friends defeat them, they themselves become the strongest within their current world. If there is no one left that could provide a challenge<span> </span><strong>at the moment</strong>, then it is logical to jump to a point in time where there<span> </span><strong>is</strong><span> </span>someone stronger. With this, DBZ's time skips take out everything unnecessary without letting anything unresolved.</p>
<p><span>In the end, what I want you to take from this article isn't that these time skips listed here are good or bad. It's that while time skips might be just another narrative device and whether someone likes a particular one is highly subjective, there is always skill involved when trying to craft every aspect of a story, just like with our paper sculpture. If you don't ensure that you're only cutting the right parts, the result might not be a skip of time, but a skip of potential.</span></p>]]></projectContents>

        <projectContents><![CDATA[<p>The legendary OP character is a trope that is typically reviled by the anime community. A common criticism of characters is that they are too powerful. For the unaware, OP stands for overpowered, and means that within a show, a character is far stronger than anyone else, and can easily beat anyone that dares to challenge them. They are often criticized both as characters and as leads of their respective stories due to being "boring" characters who make the conflict "pointless" or "forced." However, it is worth analyzing whether an OP character really deserves that criticism.</p>
<h3>PRO</h3>
<hr />
<p>Of course it's possible for an OP character to be the lead of a good story. It really boils down to one thing: presentation of the character. How is the character being presented in the series? If it's about someone who never faces challenges or struggles, this would not work. However, if this character has internal conflicts and struggles, this works on two levels to craft a strong protagonist.</p>
<p><span>First, it makes them seem more relatable, which is the key to creating a strong protagonist. A protagonist with internal struggles and trauma to deal with seems human. As viewers, we want to see a person struggling the same way we all do because it makes us invested in their story and gives it meaning for us. An example of this kind of protagonist is Saitama from </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/30276">One Punch Man</a></em><span>. Saitama trained his hardest for years on end to become the ultimate hero. He becomes so powerful, in fact, that he can defeat any opponent in a single punch. This seems like it would lead to a slightly uninteresting character, but what makes Saitama a great and relatable character is his inner conflicts. He doesn't enjoy his job or fights because of how easy they are. He is deeply unsatisfied with his life and wishes for more. We can relate to a protagonist with struggles, regardless of their power level. What makes relating to a character work on a deeper level with an OP character is that it reminds us of reality. Those we admire, those who we view as powerful and almighty, are really just people like us. They have the same fears and hopes and dreams and emotions as us. It not only shows us that even the strongest among us have demons to overcome, but also that anyone can overcome their problems. It shows us that you don't have to be some perfect, invincible, untouchable person to be a hero. It both touches us emotionally and inspires us. This is exactly what a protagonist is meant to do, and as long as internal conflicts are present within a series, the character can be a good one at the center of a good story.</span></p>
<p>The other aspect to this is that it allows for a strong structure. It is harder to successfully direct a strong series that relies on internal conflict rather than more standard ones involving another person or group as the antagonist. This makes perfect sense, considering how it is harder to show private struggles rather than flashier, more standard, action-based clashes. However, it can be done, and shows like<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/22319">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em><span> </span>and<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/5114">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></em><span> </span>are excellent examples of this sort of inner struggle when it's well-executed. Edward Elric blamed himself for the accident that led to his brother Alphonse losing his body, and had to learn to forgive himself; Ken Kaneki had to come to terms with becoming a "monster" that required human flesh. The key is clarity and focus. This aspect of well-executed shows with a primarily internal conflict becomes more important when it comes to OP characters because we need to see their struggles clearly for them to be good, relatable characters and for the show to be "worth it." When executed well, it makes it so that at the end, we feel that we've gone on a journey of sorts with the character, one that had a lot of meaning for both the audience and the character. Seeing the struggles someone who is OP goes through helps the audience form a strong bond with the character, one that simply cannot be replicated with a character of a more "normal" power level. It makes for a truly unforgettable character and show.</p>
<h3>CON</h3>
<hr />
<p>While it is not impossible for an OP character to be an enjoyable character to watch, or one the audience likes, they can inherently not be leads of a good story due to the nature of an OP character. An OP character often serves as a "power fantasy" for the audience. A character meant to be a power fantasy is a means of escape for the audience. They are there for the audience to project themselves onto as a means of feeling strong and unbeatable in a way they don't feel in their everyday lives. There is nothing wrong with this kind of character, but they do lend themselves to problems when it comes to building a strong narrative structure for two reasons.</p>
<p>One reason is that there is usually no other reason to have an OP character other than to serve as that power fantasy for the audience. In order to make a character that easily serves as a power fantasy, it usually involves making the character a bit flat. An OP character can certainly be entertaining and fun to follow, but this does not lead to being a good character. A good character is layered and complex, which is not a requirement, or the same thing, as being an entertaining one. The OP character generally must be just distinct enough to come across as powerful and heroic to the audience, but generic enough for anyone to easily imagine themselves in the character's position. The problem with translating this into a lead of a good story is that the character is not interesting and typically lacks the depth necessary to be the protagonist. An example of this sort of character is Goku from<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/223">Dragon Ball</a></em>. He is a training machine, simply "levelling up" to beat new enemies. He lacks the internal struggle and depth of a strong protagonist.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, would something like<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/5114">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></em><span> </span>or<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/22319">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em><span> </span>been have widely acclaimed if their main characters, Edward Elric and Ken Kaneki respectively, had been power fantasies? Most likely not, as the reason they were such strong characters was that they were not power fantasies. One of the reasons these characters were so widely loved was because of their internal struggles. Leads of good stories are often "regular", like us. They must be "regular", because then their creators have the freedom to make them emotionally deep, interesting, and distinct characters rather than a more generic power fantasy. A good story must have interesting characters, because otherwise, the audience will not care about anything happening in the story, making the whole narrative arc fall flat.</p>
<p>The other reason an OP character cannot lead a good story is because as mentioned earlier, their OP nature makes the story they’re in fall flat. To illustrate this point, take a look at this graph from Scriptmag. The graph is a visual representation of a narrative arc, indicating rising and falling action throughout the story. In a standard narrative arc, there is rising action, turning points, and the final climax before the falling action and resolution. Most stories follow this structure to some degree, as a story generally needs to be constructed in this fashion to properly engage the audience throughout the series and keep them invested in the eventual peak, or climax, as action rises and falls, building tension. The problem with having an OP character be the centre of the conflict, and by extension, the audience’s reason to care about the story is that the rising action, turning points and climaxes do not have any stakes to them. A story where the outcome of every battle is obvious from the beginning isn't interesting from a narrative standpoint and does little to draw a viewer in. This means that nothing happening really gets the audience invested, usually turning the whole story into a boring and predictable mess.</p>
<p>An OP character, by definition, can beat any obstacle they come across easily, and the audience is aware of this. With a “normal” protagonist, what makes the audience invested is a sense of doubt, wondering if the protagonist will be able to reach victory in the end. If victory is obviously guaranteed for the lead from the beginning, that sense of doubt is lessened or eliminated, and the story loses the meaning behind its conflict. The problem with the typical OP character is that in order to be an effective power fantasy, any real struggle defeats the purpose of having the power fantasy present. Showing a character in a moment of "weakness", whether that be in battle, mentally, or emotionally, breaks the illusion that the character creates. An OP character creates an illusion of absolute power and confidence, the person most people dream of being, an ever-confident, highly skilled, well-respected leader or fighter. When this illusion is shattered, the character loses the facade of a power fantasy, and the audience loses whatever investment they had in the series, as their investment in the lead disappears the second the fog lifts. A viewer wants to see the main character struggle and overcome their limitations and problems because it makes the eventual outcome that much sweeter, or bitter. It lends the story more meaning and makes it resonate more with the viewer when the character is not OP.</p>
<p>Most would agree that a relatable and interesting lead character is necessary to create a story with meaning that will resonate with the audience. Whether that character can be OP and still fulfill that role is up for debate, however. Whatever side of the argument you fall on, always remember the other perspective, but continue to enjoy the characters you enjoy, whether they be OP, a regular person, or somewhere in between.</p>]]></projectContents>

        <projectContents><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/5114">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></em><span> </span>is, without a doubt, one of the most beloved anime series to ever exist. This famous show teaches many important morals, from the classic "life isn't fair," to the more modern "every side is the 'good side' in their own story." However, there are also several subversive lessons that are never made obvious to the viewer. One of these subtle messages, "women do not equal weakness," is what will be focused on in this article. This message is a powerful one that has been trying to gain support worldwide for well over a century, and even though men and women are (almost) equal in a large part of the world, there are still many ways in which men have the upper hand. This is largely due to cultural and social constructions of a woman's "place" within a society versus a man's. Fullmetal Alchemist takes place in a fictional reality, but nonetheless, Arakawa Hiromu has created a world in which women can be leaders in the military, run their own businesses, and even be powerful alchemists without anyone batting an eye. Of course, not everything's equal, even in Arakawa's world, but there are plenty of strong females to provide an example of what we should be moving towards. This article contains spoilers for both the Brotherhood and<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/121/Fullmetal_Alchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em><span> </span>(2003) shows.</p>
<h3>Winry Rockbell</h3>
<hr />
<p>One of the most present female characters in the series is Winry Rockbell. As the childhood friend of both Elric brothers, as well as Edward's automail mechanic, Winry is an essential part of the story. She plays several key roles beyond fixing Ed up when he gets in a fight, such as helping the serial killer Scar realize that he is on the wrong path and providing emotional support for the Elric brothers when things get hard. Winry's strength is shown in many different ways. First is in her abilities as an automail mechanic and surgeon. She is the sole engineer of Edward's arm and leg, creating them from scratch at the age of 11. The second is her resilience after the deaths of her parents in the Ishvalan War of Extermination. Despite the sudden deaths of her parents, Winry holds her head high and looks on the bright side. Next is Winry's independence. She often travels alone to see the Elrics and at one point settles down on her own in Rush Valley to apprentice under a master automail mechanic. After that is her determination to help Scar, despite the fact that he killed her parents. She treats his injuries and helps him escape, saying that she doesn't forgive him for the murder of her parents, but that she can't let him suffer. The final thing is Winry's bravery when she is brought to Fort Briggs as an unwitting hostage against the Elric brothers. She isn't aware of it initially, but after the Elric brothers tell her the truth, she helps them by lying to Kimblee in order to accompany the group to Baschool and pretending to be captured by Scar so that a portion of their allies could escape. Winry is often thought of as just the mechanic who appears whenever Ed breaks his automail, but without her determination and faith in humanity, the Elric brothers might never have succeeded on the Promised Day.</p>
<h3>Trisha Elric</h3>
<hr />
<p>Also from Resembool is Edward and Alphonse's mother, Trisha Elric. Trisha has little screen time as she is deceased before the beginning of the show, but she has a huge influence on the Elric brothers, especially Edward, throughout the course of the show. While she was alive, Trisha was a wonderfully supportive mother. She encouraged her sons in their pursuit of alchemy and encouraged her husband to be the hands-on father he wanted to be. Her strength shows when Hohenheim announces that he has to leave without giving a reason. She is clearly surprised but quickly accepts it. She allows her husband to leave for an indefinite amount of time and continues with raising their sons by herself. She remains strong for her sons the rest of her life, even when she becomes gravely ill. She hides her illness from her sons for as long as possible so that they might continue to live normal, happy lives. Until the very end, she didn't give up on her family, always ready with a smile for Ed and Al and full of faith in her husband.</p>
<h3>Riza Hawkeye</h3>
<hr />
<p>Another character that plays a significant role is Riza Hawkeye. Hawkeye's strength is much more apparent than many of the other characters', as she's lived a rather tragic life. Throughout the show, we learn that she has a bit of a strained relationship with her father through the fact that he tattooed the final array of his research onto her back when she was a teenager. After the war, she asks Mustang to burn it off her back, freeing her from the burden of her father's research. Another example of her strength is her time during the war. She joined as a sniper of her own accord and chose to live with the blood on her hands and move forward afterward rather than giving up and quitting. She tells Edward, "Ordinary soldiers could fire rounds indiscriminately and hope to hit something. But for snipers, it was different. When we pull the trigger, someone is sure to die." Throughout the course of the show, the audience comes to realize how much Hawkeye and Mustang depend on and draw their strength from each other. The one time Riza loses control of herself is when she believes that Roy has been killed by Lust, and even then, she goes out with a bang, so to speak. She fires every single bullet she has into Lust in retaliation before finally giving up. As soon as she knows Mustang is alive, she gets back up again. Another show of Hawkeye's strength comes when she is reassigned to be the personal assistant of Fuhrer Bradley, making her a hostage against Mustang. It is somewhat apparent to the viewer that she is terrified of her new position, especially knowing as much as she does about the Fuhrer and the homunculi, but she puts on her poker face and does what both Bradley and Mustang ask of her. Finally, Riza is strong even against Roy, despite him being her reason for living. She often stands up to him, refusing to follow his orders, especially when they involve leaving him behind. When she follows him into the tunnels beneath Central, she remains guarded, even against Envy, who appears to be Roy Mustang. She tricks him into admitting that he is actually Envy, and proceeds to attack. Whether on her own or in a team, Riza Hawkeye is a force to be reckoned with. She is one of the most prominent female leads and can hold her own in both a fight and in life.</p>
<h3>Olivier Mira Armstrong</h3>
<hr />
<p>Another prominent female lead, Olivier Mira Armstrong is a general in the Amestrian military, commanding the Briggs Fortress on the northern border between Amestris and Drachma. She is known for saying, "At Briggs, only the strongest survive." Every soldier serving under her is extremely loyal to her to the point that they would betray the government of Amestris if it meant remaining true. She seems to have made her strength a large part of her personality, perhaps because she has been made to prove it time and time again. There is one moment in the series when she shows the viewers that equality has not truly been achieved in Amestris: when she tricks General Raven into revealing the Fuhrer's plans by playing the "vulnerable female" card. She pitches her voice softer and tells him how most women her age are expected to have settled down by then and had a family. She fools him into believing that she would be receptive to his cause, before revealing that she was lying and killing him. However, she is not only the stereotypical "female boss" character; there is a true compassionate side to her as well. When she sends some men into the tunnel Sloth digs to investigate, she tells them that she won't let them back up after 10 o'clock, but then gives the timekeeper a broken watch that will never reach ten. Olivier Armstrong is a forceful person, but there is more to her than just that.</p>
<h3>Gracia Hughes</h3>
<hr />
<p>A character with a different sort of strength is Gracia Hughes. She is very similar to Trisha, which is one of the reasons the Elrics grow attached to her so quickly, and many of her scenes involve her acting maternally towards either Edward, Alphonse, Winry, or her daughter, Elicia. She actually doesn't have much of a personality beyond "perfect mother" and "supportive wife" until her husband dies and her strength of character is revealed. She is definitely grieving for her husband, but at the same time, she is resolute in her decision to move on and not to live in the past. She realizes that dwelling on the "what-ifs" helps no one, especially not her young daughter, so she puts that behind her and goes on with her life.</p>
<h3>Maria Ross</h3>
<hr />
<p>Maria Ross is another soldier of the Amestrian military. She has as much strength as any other soldier, but one unique to Ross is her adaptability. This is most apparent in the scene where Mustang forces her to fake her death in order to escape incarceration for the murder of Maes Hughes (which she did not commit). At first, she is very overwhelmed from escaping prison, running from the police, then being spared by Roy Mustang, when she was certain he was going to kill her. After she climbs into the hole behind the dumpster, she is finally informed of the colonel's plan. There, she has one dramatic moment where she laments her situation before she steels herself and tells Havoc she's ready to leave. Maria's strengths may not be so clearly stated as some of the other characters', but she is no weakling.</p>
<h3>Madame Christmas</h3>
<hr />
<p>Our next woman isn't in the military, but she has quite a few connections. Madame Christmas runs a bar that may or may not also be a brothel. She and the girls working for her are Mustang's main informants, getting information from loose-lipped military men that visit their establishment. Their strengths lay in deception and the sly collection of secrets. Without the Madame and her girls, Roy would never have been able to uncover as much about the Fuhrer as he did, nor would he have been able to keep up his debaucherous cover as well.</p>
<h3>Lust</h3>
<hr />
<p>The final female character we will mention in depth is one of the strongest, yet also one of the most problematic. Lust is the only homunculus who identifies as female out of all seven, which enforces the idea that lust is a feeling only females are susceptible to. Her personality and physical appearance both serve to make her the embodiment of the "female player". She uses her looks and sensuality to get what she wants, without caring about the people she's messing with. She is also somewhat of an authority within the homunculi, as both Gluttony and Envy follow her orders. However, there isn't much more to her personality besides that. Her character falls a bit flat, which might be explained by the fact that she is supposed to embody only one of the seven deadly sins if it weren't for the fact that many of the other "sins" have much more dynamic personalities than she does. Her only defining characteristics seem to be her desirability and disdain for humans.</p>
<h3>May Chang</h3>
<hr />
<p>This is not the only problematic representation of females within the Brotherhood series. May Chang is shown to be a bit easily enamored, like the stereotypical teenage girl. She first has an infatuation with Edward Elric, despite not knowing what he looked like or anything about him. When she finds out what he is really like, she quickly throws away her ideals of him and moves on to his brother Alphonse, who is much more like what she'd envisioned Edward to be. While this is humorous and adds a bit of levity to the serious situations they find themselves in, it serves to encourage both young girls to be like that, as well as young boys to expect that behavior of girls. This type of behavior is also somewhat present in Winry Rockbell. In addition to being Edward's childhood friend, she is also his love interest. There are several moments throughout the show where she says stereotypical “teenage girl” things, the most notable being, “Have his shoulders always been so broad?” as Ed walks away from her.<br /><br /><br />Despite including some representations of female stereotypes,<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/5114">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></em><span> </span>has brought one of the most important messages of the 21st century to lives all over the world. Women are not weak for being female, nor are they unfeminine for being strong. A strong woman can still have compassion and traditionally feminine qualities without giving up her power. Brotherhood shows people, rather than telling them, that women can be equal without the world turning on its head. Through the fight against the homunculi, it shows us that women are just as human as men are.</p>]]></projectContents>

        <projectContents><![CDATA[<p>We live in a wonderful age where love can sprout between any combinations of gender, sex, race, age, nationality, etc. Leave it to anime to take this just one step too far and end up right in the land of the bizarre. Many anime out there celebrate the love between any gender (even if some of it leans towards the<span> </span><a href="https://myanimelist.net/featured/1917">creepy rapey side</a>). But the anime below ask, well if a woman can fall in love with another woman, why can't she fall in love with the soul of a samurai trapped inside a vending machine?<br /><br /></p>
<p>On one hand we have to tip our hats to anyone so accepting of love in many different shapes and sizes. On the other hand, well, these relationships between people and things can vary from being downright weird to oddly charming.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Here are 7 bizarre love stories we dug up from the world of anime.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<h2>Love between a woman and a samurai's soul trapped in a vending machine</h2>
<hr />
<p>What, did you think we were kidding before? We couldn't come up with this stuff. In<span> </span><em>Coffee Samurai</em>, college student Hemi falls in love with Jin… who happens to be a coffee vending machine. But Jin isn't just any vending machine: he is a samurai from the Sengoku period (14th - 16th century). The story manages to be weird and endearing at the same time, with both protagonists coming off as quirky and likeable, a feat that some non-vending machine anime characters have trouble with.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<h2>Love between a telephone pole and an electrician</h2>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<p>It's one thing for a human to fall in love with an object, but what happens when an inanimate object becomes obsessed with a human?<span> </span><em>Elemi</em><span> </span>is the story of a telephone pole in pre-cellphone Japan who falls head over heels (so to speak) with an electrician named Mr. Takahashi. Her infatuation leads to her desperate attempt to contact him, which she does by calling him up and pretending to be human. Unfortunately, this kind of interaction between power poles and humans is forbidden, and Elemi must stand trial for her actions in court. It's an allegorical tale that's immensely relatable, despite the physical form of the characters involved.</p>

<h2>Love between a ghost and a boy</h2>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<p>This anime follows<span> </span><a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/65397/Mitsuki_Kanzaki">Mitsuki Kanzaki</a>, who must adjust to living with a new family. Turns out that's the least of Mitsuki's problems when she's possessed by the ghost of a girl who was madly in love with a boy. A boy who now happens to be Mitsuki's step-brother. To help the ghost move on, Mitsuki has to engage in sexual acts with her step-brother. Yes, we realize it's just an excuse for some step-sibling incest, and yes, we realize the West has its own version of the story with<span> </span><em>Ghost</em>, but at least there's no familial ties in Ghost, and only one awkwardly sensual scene.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<h2>Love between a guy and his hand (no, not like that)</h2>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/3626/Seiji_Sawamura">Seiji Sawamura</a><span> </span>is an outcast, a wild guy who's feared by all. Even when he tries to act kind, girls are afraid of him because of his reputation, making it hard for him to get a girlfriend. Little does he know that watching all this is the sweet and soft-spoken<span> </span><a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/3627/Midori_Kasugano">Midori Kasugano</a>, who is deeply in love with him. That is, until he wakes up with Midori literally living as his right hand. As in, a tiny girl emerges from his arm instead of his hand.<span> </span><em>Midori Days</em><span> </span>follows this bizarre relationship as the two try to get Midori back to normal, and grow closer as a result of literally being connected. It should be weird, it should be awkward, yet somehow, this is one of those bizarre anime love stories that end up being oddly endearing.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<h2>Love between scientist and a headless Celtic spirit of the dead</h2>
<hr />
<p><em>Warning: Early-series spoilers follow. If you haven't watched up to episode 4, you may want to skip this one.</em><br /><br /></p>
<p><a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/28331/Celty_Sturluson">Celty Sturluson</a><span> </span>and<span> </span><a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/24597/Shinra_Kishitani">Shinra Kishitani</a><span> </span>have an interesting relationship, to say the least. As a man of science, Shinra sees Celty as a medical oddity, but from the very beginning there is clearly more to the relationship than meets the eye. Somehow through the magic of<span> </span><em>Durarara!!</em><span> </span>the way the two co-exist seems completely normal, making us almost forget that Celty is the spirit of the dead, and oh yeah she<span> </span><em>has no head</em>. Just a minor detail.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<h2>Love between a man and the physical manifestation of the sea<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/2890/Gake_no_Ue_no_Ponyo"></a></h2>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<p><em>Ponyo</em><span> </span>is a charming movie about a little fish girl discovering the wonders of the human world -- a level of fantasy and innocence that we've come to expect from Studio Ghibli. And although humans and mermaids co-mingling is a well-treaded path, there's one relationship in the movie that's a bit more on the bizarre side than we'd expect: that of Ponyo's father and mother.<span> </span><a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/17230/Fujimoto">Fujimoto</a><span> </span>is in a relationship with<span> </span><a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/17232/Granmammare">Granmammare</a>, a physical manifestation of the sea. She can make herself relatively human-sized but most of the time she is a larger-than-life goddess of the sea; she<span> </span><em>is</em><span> </span>the sea. In a way,<span> </span><em>Ponyo</em><span> </span>shows that love has no boundaries.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<h2>Love between a little girl and a winged horse</h2>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<p>The<span> </span><em>Sailor Moon</em><span> </span>series has some unconventional characters, but<span> </span><em>SuperS</em><span> </span>dips its toes in the bizarre with the relationship between<span> </span><a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/2827/Chibiusa">Chibiusa</a><span> </span>and<span> </span><a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/6846/Helios">Helios</a><span> </span>in his Pegasus form. The two experience tender moments together to the backdrop of a sad love song, and even share a kiss. While much of this takes place in a dream sequence, it's still a bizarre sequence that portrays love between a winged horse and a 10 year old girl.</p>]]></projectContents>

        <projectContents><![CDATA[<p>In the world of anime, we encounter thousands of characters and personalities. Some we love; others we love to hate. It's no surprise that the characters we know and love fall into some sort of archetype. As literary fans will confirm, archetypes are the key players of any story. However, compared to literature, anime allows more creative license, giving producers the freedom to truly portray personality quirks and physical differences. This makes you wonder: are our favorite characters solely based on our own preferences? Or are they based on something deeper?</p>
<p>Now, some of you may be wondering: what in Kami-sama's name is an archetype? To briefly sum up, an archetype is a set of personality traits that make up a specific persona. For example, Naruto, Ichigo, and Goku would be the "hero" archetype. Don't get confused; just because they are main characters doesn’t automatically make them part of the "hero" archetype. Supporting characters can also be part of the hero archetype. However, most anime do have a hero as their main character—sometimes even more than one.</p>
<p>Importantly, even within an archetype, no two characters are exactly identical. Each one is a unique mix of archetype traits and their own personality. Take the previous examples: Naruto, Ichigo, and Goku would never "kick a guy while he's down." This is their archetype, just like how they're all a little slow in their studies. However, their approaches to training, especially at the very beginning of their respective stories, are very different.</p>
<p>These three characters, though they might be generic, are loved by millions around the world. Being a part of the millennial generation as many anime fans are, researching what these kinds of characters inspire within their fandoms is pretty simple. It's obvious to most that they are, essentially, the underdogs. We all love a good underdog story, but is that all there is to it? Sure, Goku is naively kind, Ichigo is stubbornly confident, and Naruto has his "ninja way," but I felt there was something beyond these obvious facts that I had to find.</p>
<p>Archetypes, throughout time, have remained mostly unchanged. In fact, Carl Jung first applied this term to literature. He noticed that characters hardly changed over centuries of oral and written myths, religions, poetry, and history. Jung then hypothesized that the human species must have a collective subconscious that acts as a universal, and primal, memory.</p>
<p>His theory, despite its detail, didn't really explain why these characters were so endearing. Many fans of literature think back on the most beloved characters from great books such as War and Peace, Harry Potter, Canterbury Tales, and The Hobbit. They were all written in different time periods, but remain centered around vivid characters and deeper meanings. Each has protagonists whom we can't help but empathize with, which makes you think that maybe that was the collective conscience Jung was talking about. Could it be that, no matter the era or the situation, human beings generally imagine themselves as the hero? A question like that seems to have the obvious answer of "yes," but is it that simple to put yourself in someone else's shoes? It is as if Pandora’s Box (even though the correct phrase would be "Pandora's Jar") started spewing more questions than answers. The frustration of generic characters makes you seriously reconsider what it all means for some of the most loved characters in the anime universe.</p>
<p>The word "recycled" keeps popping up and it really eats at you. Not only are you invested in characters, plotlines, and worlds, but it is also the compelling hope that someday, we’ll get to experience catharsis. Fans are invested in the chance to see a culmination of everything, but mostly the final development of our favorite characters. With the ending of<span> </span><em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1735/Naruto__Shippuuden">Naruto Shippuden</a></em><span> </span>happening only a few months ago, many of us felt the ultimate bliss as the conclusion finally came. The wonderful and seemingly inconceivable ending was not what many expected from Konoha's most unpredictable knuckle-headed ninja, especially from episode one. It stands to reason that this is what we all look for in a story. Don't we go crazy for that development and that journey? And then, like Kenpachi in a good fight, you feel excited— teleported to another world.</p>
<p>The reason we love these characters so much isn't because of some predetermined collective memory or because of their similarities. This can apply to any favorite character, no matter their role or archetype. What we, as human beings, remember most are our emotional milestones and significant moments. We are always searching for the next one and this translates into anime so well with its flashy characters and intricate storylines. We see their triumphs as a reflection of our own and, in a way, connect ourselves with their situation. By now, this is starting to sound like some garden variety psychology, but it is so much more than that. Artistic interpretation has always varied from person to person and our favorite anime is where we can express that individual view. Even within the stereotypes we are given.</p>
<p>When we see these characters—especially the stereotypical heroes—we immediately see their most redeeming quality. It's almost certain that, within the first episode, it's clear what kind of character they are. If they're so predictable, why do we love them? Why aren't we boycotting the stereotypical hero archetype? Because we are a species of stereotypical heroes. They embody everything that our species, as a whole, view as ideal. They are strong, courageous, honorable, and tenacious, selflessly facing their problems head-on. Likewise, we see our own weaknesses in these characters as they struggle through their storylines and emotions. Thus, more often than not, they become our favorites. Just like how stories and folktales have a hidden meaning, our favorite characters actually represent the underlying story of our humanity.</p>
<p>Isn't that so typical of our species? We create the ideal worlds we want to see, helping us reach millions around the globe. By doing this, we start to understand, and better appreciate, individuality through the artistry and genius of anime and manga. Even if it's only subconsciously, the artists, fans, and community all treasure this sense of ideal human interaction and reaction that ultimately connects us as a species. Perhaps that is why we love those characters so much. We see in them everything that connects us in this usually harsh world.</p>]]></projectContents>
